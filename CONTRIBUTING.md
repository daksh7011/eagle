# Contributing

1. File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

#Filing an issue
Use the issue tracker to start the discussion. It is possible that someone else is already working on your idea,
your approach is not quite right, or that the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue 
tracker will be used to hash that all out.

#Code Style

* Write in UTF-8 in PHP
* Always use 4 spaces for indentation (don't use tabs)
* Always try to limit line length to 80 characters
* Class names should always be capitalized
* Function names should always be lowercase
* Look at the existing style and adhere accordingly

#Forking the repository
Be sure to do relevant tests before making the pull request. You should also build the docs yourself and make sure 
they're readable.

#Making Pull Request
Once you have made all your changes, tests, make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the 
repository. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request. Expect some back-and-forth with regards to 
style and compliance of these rules.

**Good Luck!**
